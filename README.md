## What does your application do?
Mental Health Journaling App aimed at CS Students: Create a journaling app focused on mental health and well-being. Users will be able to record their daily thoughts, moods, and experiences, and the app can provide insights and suggestions for improving mental health.

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

We plan to incorporate a chatbot, and add additional intelligent features. We will use widgets and buttons to make the experience user-friendly. We also wanted to experiment with NLP with the chatbot for sentiment analysis. Add achievements and badges possibly.

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?

Authorized logins <br />
Security of their information <br />
Unauthorized access <br />
Accessibility and reliability of website (Secure against DoS attacks) <br />
Ability to scale up (if more people than what the servers can handle access our website)


### This repository

This repository has a package.json that functions as a blank shell that gets full credit if you turn it in to the gradescope autograder. We will not be using the autograder in any way to actually evaluate your project, it is just there to keep track of your initial submission.

We recommend that you use this repository for your final project code. This will allow you to ask questions on Piazza and get help from the TAs and instructors. Adding a real linter, type checker, etc, based on our other examples would be a good idea.
